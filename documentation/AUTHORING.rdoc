= Slide Format

You can break your slides up into sections of however many subdirectories deep
you need.  ShowOff will recursively check all the directories mentioned in
your <tt>showoff.json</tt> file for any markdown files (.md).  Each markdown file can
have any number of slides in it, separating each slide with the '!SLIDE'
keyword and one or more optional slide styles.

For example, if you run '<tt>showoff create my_new_pres</tt>' it will create a new
starter presentation for you with one .md file at one/slide.md which will have
the following contents:

    !SLIDE

    # My Presentation #

    !SLIDE bullets incremental transition=fade

    # Bullet Points #

    * first point
    * second point
    * third point

That represents two slides, the first contains just a large title, and the
second is faded into view showing the title and three bullets that are then
incrementally shown. In order for ShowOff to see those slides, your
<tt>showoff.json</tt> file needs to look something like this:

    {
      "name": "Something",
      "description": "Example Presentation",
      "sections": [
        {"section":"one"}
      ]
    }

If you have multiple sections in your talk, you can make this json
array include all the sections you want to show in which order you
want to show them. Template configuration is done in
<tt>showoff.json</tt> as well.

Instead of a hash, you can use a plain string as an entry in the
<tt>sections</tt> section of <tt>showoff.json</tt>. And if that plain string starts
with '#' then it is interpreted not as a filename, but as
markdown. This is used for inserting interstitial slides or notes --
for instance, Alex Chaffee's {Ruby
Notes}[http://github.com/alexch/ruby_notes] uses it to insert lab
instructions between lecture slide sections, which may vary from venue
to venue.

You can use angle brackets around the `!SLIDE` keyword and styles, if you'd like.
For example:

    <!SLIDE bullets incremental transition=fade>

This lets you keep the ability to emit an HTML document from your Markdown source
file -- say, for a TextMate preview or a GitHub rendering

You can link to specific slides using either a slide number, the name of the
slide, or the GitHub style normalized version of the first line of text on the
slide. The number can be found in the URL of your browser, and the name is shown
in the debug output or in the status bar of the presenter view. Normalized names
have all non alpha-numeric characters replaced with a hyphen.

== Markdown Format

Showoff renders Markdown format as documented at http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.
Many of the rendering engines supported by Showoff provide extensions allowing more
formatting options not available in core Markdown. Each engine provides different options
and the defaults for each are documented in the Markdown Engine section. The full options
supported by each engine can be found in their respective documentations.

Some of the extensions include:

[autolink] Recognize and parse bare links even when they are not marked up properly.
[definition_lists] Parse definition lists, {PHP-Markdown}[https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#def-list] style.
[strikethrough] Parse strikethrough text surrounded with two <tt>~~</tt> characters.
[superscript] Parse superscripts after a `^` character.
[tables] Parse tables, {PHP-Markdown}[https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#table] style.
[underline] Parse underscored emphasis as underlines. This is <tt>\_underlined\_</tt> but this is still <tt>\*emphasis\*</tt>.

Showoff extensions to the language are documented below.

= Slide Styles

Some useful styles for each slide are listed below. Many of them can be combined.

[center] centers images on a slide
[full-page] allows an image to take up the whole slide
[bullets] sizes and separates bullets properly (fits up to 5, generally)
[smbullets] sizes and separates more bullets (smaller, closer together)
[subsection] creates a different background for titles
[command] monospaces h1 title slides
[commandline] for pasted commandline sections (needs leading '$' for commands, then output on subsequent lines)
[code] monospaces everything on the slide
[incremental] can be used with 'bullets' and 'commandline' styles, will incrementally update elements on arrow key rather than switch slides
[inverse] changes to a dark background and light text.
[small] make all slide text 80%
[smaller] make all slide text 70%
[execute] on Javascript, Coffeescript, Ruby, and Shell highlighted code slides, you can click on the code to execute it and display the results on the slide
[printonly] this slide should only appear in the printed version of the presentation
[noprint] this slide will not appear in the printed version of the presentation
[supplemental] rather than adding a slide to the main presentation, add a slide to supplemental materials. See below.
[form=id] Render form elements on this slide with a given form ID. See below, and in FORMS.rdoc.
[background-fit] Scales a background image to the largest size that both height and width are onscreen. The default is to completely fill the slide.
[bigtext] This will enlarge all the contents of the slide to the maximum possible size. <em>Caution, this should only be used for slides with just a few words or short phrases!</em>
[autoplay] If you've included videos on the slide, this style will cause them to play when you switch to this slide.
[activity] If you tag this slide as an <tt>activity</tt>, then audience members' presentations will get a toggle button on their slide, and their presentation will stop tracking along until they toggle it to complete. The presenter sees a count of all incompletes in the lower right of their slide preview.

Check out the example directory included to see examples of most of these.

== Callout paragraph styles

Several custom "callout" paragraph styles are included. This allows you to highlight points
in your presentation, with a callout box and an optional icon. To do this, add <tt>.callout</tt>
or <tt>.callout.[style]</tt> as the first word of your paragraph, such as:

    <!SLIDE >
    # Example callout paragraphs

    .callout This paragraph will be highlighted with an outlined box.

    .callout.info Adding the `.info` modifier adds an info icon.

rdoc-image:../images/callouts.png

== Font Awesome

Font awesome icons can be included by using <tt>[fa-iconname]</tt> which creates an <i> tag
with the "fa" class and any other classes contained in the <tt>[</tt> and <tt>]</tt> characters. The "fa-" string
needs to be the first thing in the brackets so <tt>[fa-smile-o someclass]</tt> will render as an <i> tag but
<tt>[someclass fa-smile-o]</tt> will not.

See the {Font Awesome project}[http://fontawesome.io/icons/] for a list of icons you can use.

= Supplemental Materials

Supplemental materials may be created by including <tt>supplemental</tt> and the name of a type
in the <!SLIDE> styles. For example, you might have a slide like

    <!SLIDE supplemental exercises>
    # Lab ~~~SECTION:MAJOR~~~.~~~SECTION:MINOR~~~: This is a lab
    ## Objective: Do something
    [... slide content ...]

The supplemental materials may be accessed at http://localhost:9090/supplemental/$type-name.
For example, the material described in the example above would be accessed at
http://localhost:9090/supplemental/exercises. If you have slides and supplemental material
that are related to one another, they could be contained in the same file. This makes
it extraordinarily easy to reorder the presentation.

= Slide Transitions

Transitions can be supplied through the use of transition=tname on the !SLIDE
definition, where tname is one of the following supported transitions:

- blindX
- blindY
- blindZ
- cover
- curtainX
- curtainY
- fade
- fadeZoom
- growX
- growY
- none (this is the default)
- scrollUp
- scrollDown
- scrollLeft
- scrollRight
- scrollHorz
- scrollVert
- shuffle
- slideX
- slideY
- toss
- turnUp
- turnDown
- turnLeft
- turnRight
- uncover
- wipe
- zoom

The transitions are provided by jQuery Cycle plugin. See http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle/browser.html to view the effects and http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle/adv2.html for how to add custom effects.

= Slide Backgrounds

A custom per slide background can be set in the slide options. For example:

     !SLIDE[bg=customLogo.png]

Unlike image tags on a slide, the path to background images must start from the
root of the presentation.

By default, the background will be scaled to completely cover the slide. If you
specify the <tt>background-fit</tt> slide style, then the background will be
scaled to the largest size that both height and width fit within the slide.

= Language Highlighting

Showoff uses {Highlight.js}[https://highlightjs.org] (version 9.15.10) to highlight
code blocks. If you begin a code block with *four spaces* and three @-signs followed
by a programming language name, that line will be stripped and the rest of the block
will become sparkly and colorful. You can uppercase the name if you like, and if you
add the `numbers` keyword, it will be rendered with line numbers.

    @@@ Ruby
    10.times { puts "Whee!" }

With line numbers:

    @@@ Ruby numbers
    10.times { puts "Whee!" }

To highlight a specific line in your snippet of code, simply prefix it with a <tt>*</tt>.

    @@@ Ruby execute
    ['one', 'two', 'three'].collect do |item|
      puts item
    ﹡  puts item.upcase  # This line will be highlighted to call attention to it
    end

Instructions for adding support for new languages can be found at
http://highlightjs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/language-contribution.html

== Syntax highlighting styles

You can configure the highlighting style used by providing a <tt>highlight</tt>
key in the <tt>showoff.json</tt> file. For example:

    {
      "name": "Something",
      "description": "Example Presentation",
      "highlight": "agate",
      ...
    }

Highlighting styles include:

    agate                     atelier-seaside.light        mono-blue
    androidstudio             atelier-sulphurpool.dark     monokai
    arta                      atelier-sulphurpool.light    monokai_sublime
    ascetic                   brown_paper                  obsidian
    atelier-cave.dark         codepen-embed                paraiso.dark
    atelier-cave.light        color-brewer                 paraiso.light
    atelier-dune.dark         dark                         pojoaque
    atelier-dune.light        darkula                      railscasts

    atelier-seaside.dark      magula                       zenburn


== Console Windows

If you'd like to show a representation of a console window, you can use the syntax highlight
styles of <tt>Console</tt> and <tt>PowerShellConsole</tt>. You can also add the class of
<tt>nochrome</tt> if you don't want the window titlebars drawn.

For example:

    @@@ Console
    root@localhost # echo "This is a console window"

<br>

    @@@ PowerShellConsole
    PS C:\> echo "This is a PowerShell window"

<br>

    @@@ Console nochrome
    root@localhost # echo "This is a console window with no titlebar"

<br>

    @@@ PowerShellConsole nochrome
    PS C:\> echo "This is a PowerShell window with no titlebar"


== Rendering Diagrams

Showoff includes the {Mermaid}[http://knsv.github.io/mermaid] diagram renderer, which allows
you to describe diagrams with a simple language and style them with CSS. To do so, create a
code block using a highlight style of <tt>render-diagram</tt>.

For example:

    @@@ render-diagram
    gantt
        dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
        title Adding GANTT diagram functionality to mermaid
        section A section
        Completed task            :done,    des1, 2014-01-06,2014-01-08
        Active task               :active,  des2, 2014-01-09, 3d
        Future task               :         des3, after des2, 5d
        Future task2              :         des4, after des3, 5d
        section Critical tasks
        Completed task in the critical line :crit, done, 2014-01-06,24h
        Implement parser and jison          :crit, done, after des1, 2d
        Create tests for parser             :crit, active, 3d
        Future task in critical line        :crit, 5d
        Create tests for renderer           :2d
        Add to mermaid                      :1d

See http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/index.html#flowcharts-basic-syntax for a syntax tutorial.


= Forms

Showoff extends Markdown to render a limited subset of form elements. This is mostly useful for polls,
quizzes, surveys, etc. See FORMS.rdoc for more complete information.

= Sections

== Presenter Notes

Surround presenter notes with <tt>~~~SECTION:notes~~~</tt> and <tt>~~~ENDSECTION~~~</tt> tags. It will
display in the bottom section of the presenter view. The footer on the display window
will also  display shorter notes. Toggle these with the n key while in the presentation.

    ~~~SECTION:notes~~~

    This is a presenter note example.

    ~~~ENDSECTION~~~

=== Personal Notes

In some use cases, it's useful to have personal notes that are separate from the presenter notes built
into the presentation itself. For example, you might share a presentation repository with others, but would
like the ability add your own notes to slides. This can be done by creating a markdown file in the
<tt>_notes</tt> directory of your presentation. The filename should mirror the name of the slide.

For example, if the name displayed in the presenter view status bar was <tt>Introduction/About</tt>
then the personal notes file should be <tt>_notes/Introduction/About.md</tt>.

== Handout Notes

Surround handout notes with <tt>~~~SECTION:handouts~~~</tt> and <tt>~~~ENDSECTION~~~</tt> tags. It will
display below the slide in the printed version..

    ~~~SECTION:handouts~~~

    This is supplementary material that will appear in the printed version.

    ~~~ENDSECTION~~~

Handout notes are best viewed by printing the <tt>/print</tt> view from your browser. Each slide will
be printed on a new page and handout notes will be included below the slide contents. Handout notes can
contain any markup that the slide itself can.

== Adding Notes Sections

You can add arbitrary section types by simply declaring them on a slide. All sections attached to
a slide can be chosen from a flyaway tab widget in the notes field in the presenter. For example,
if a slide contained the following notes sections,

    ~~~SECTION:notes~~~
    This is a presenter note example.
    ~~~ENDSECTION~~~

    ~~~SECTION:handouts~~~
    This is supplementary material that will appear in the printed version.
    ~~~ENDSECTION~~~

    ~~~SECTION:guide~~~
    This is an additional notes section that may be chosen from the tab bar.
    ~~~ENDSECTION~~~

then the section selector would contain <tt>notes</tt>, <tt>handouts</tt>, and <tt>guide</tt>.

== Printing Notes Sections

When printing the presentation, you can choose which notes section to attach below the slides.

    # Prints the presenter notes
    showoff static print notes

    # Prints a section called "guide"
    showoff static print guide

By default, the <tt>handouts</tt> section will be attached. In other words, <tt>showoff static print</tt>
will behave just like <tt>showoff static print handouts</tt>.

= Other Tags

[~~~SECTION:MAJOR~~~]
  This is the section major number. It is a counter that increments each time a subsection tag is
  encountered.

[~~~SECTION:MINOR~~~]
  This is the section minor number. It is incremented each time it is used and reset each time a
  subsection tag is encountered.

[~~~FILE:filename.ext~~~]
[~~~FILE:filename.ext:filetype~~~]
  Includes the content of a file in the <tt>_files</tt> directory on the slide as code. If the
  optional <tt>filetype</tt> is included then the code block will be syntax highlighted appropriately.

[~~~PAGEBREAK~~~]
  Just generates a <code><div class="pagebreak">continued...</div></code> HTML snippet which is styled
  as a hard page break in modern HTML rendering engines.

[~~~TOC~~~]
  Generates a Table of Contents using the subsection titles. Some renderers (such as
  PrinceXML[http://www.princexml.com]) are able to autonumber the table with links to content.

[~~~FORM:id~~~]
  Places a continuously updating block displaying the live results from the form with the given ID.
  This is most useful when you're performing a poll or pop quiz during the presentation.

= Preshow

If you want to show a slideshow while you wait to speak, you can run a preshow.
Add a <tt>_preshow</tt> directory to your project (I use a symlink, so I don't
have to add all the images into Git), put a bunch of images in the
<tt>_preshow</tt> directory and optionally add a <tt>preshow.json</tt> file that
provides descriptions for any of the images.  If you then press '<tt>P</tt>' on the display screen at the
beginning of your presentation, it will prompt you for a number of minutes until
you start.  Then it will count down the time until then, flipping through your
pictures to entertain the audience in the meantime.  Press '<tt>P</tt>' again to stop, or
wait until the timer runs out.

Your optional <tt>preshow.json<\tt> file should be formatted like so:

    {
      "ImageFileName1.png":"Image Title and/or Description",
    }
    {
      "ImageFileName2.jpg":"Image Title and/or Description",
    }

= Download Files

Add a line that starts with <tt>.download</tt> and contains the name of a file in the <tt>_files</tt>
subdirectory of your presentation.

    .download file.tar.gz

Once the instructor has viewed the next slide in your presentation, the file listed here will
be available to download on the <tt>/download</tt> page. For example, if the file was referenced
on page #42, then the file would be listed when the instructor advances to slide #43.

<em>Note, this means only the *next* slide, not any subsequent slide.</em>

To share files on an ad-hoc basis, the instructor can simply drop files into <tt>_files/share</tt>.
All files existing in this directory will be listed when students hit the download page. Showoff
does not need to be restarted, even if you drop files in here during a presentation.


= Showing Plain Old Markdown

If a Markdown file has no !SLIDE keywords, then Showoff will treat every line
beginning with a single hash -- i.e. every H1 -- as a new slide in "bullets"
style. Remember that you can't specify classes or transitions in this mode,
and as soon as you add one !SLIDE you need them everywhere.


= Custom JavaScript

To insert custom JavaScript into your presentation you can either place it into
a file (with extension .js) into the root directory of your presentation or you
can embed a <code><script></code> element directly into your slides. This JavaScript will be
executed--as usually--as soon as it is loaded.

If you want to trigger some JavaScript as soon as a certain page is shown or
when you switch to the next or previous slide, you can bind a callback to a
custom event:

showoff:show:: will be triggered as soon as you enter a page
showoff:next:: will be triggered when you switch to the next page
showoff:incr:: will be triggered when you advance to the next increment on the page
showoff:prev:: will be triggered when you switch to the previous page

These events are triggered on the "div.content" child of the slide, so you must
add a custom and unique class to your SLIDE to identify it:

    !SLIDE custom_and_unique_class
    # 1st Example h1
    <script>
    // bind to custom event
    $(".custom_and_unique_class").bind("showoff:show", function (event) {
      // animate the h1
      var h1 = $(event.target).find("h1");
      h1.delay(500)
        .slideUp(300, function () { $(this).css({textDecoration: "line-through"}); })
        .slideDown(300);
    });
    </script>

This will bind an event handler for *showoff:show* to your slide. The
h1-element will be animated, as soon as this event is triggered on that slide.

If you bind an event handler to the custom events *showoff:next* or
*showoff:prev*, you can prevent the default action (that is switching to the
appropriate slide) by calling *event.preventDefault()*:

    !SLIDE prevent_default
    # 2nd Example h1
    <script>
    $(".prevent_default").bind("showoff:next", function (event) {
      var h1 = $(event.target).find("h1");
      if (h1.css("text-decoration") === "none") {
        event.preventDefault();
        h1.css({textDecoration: "line-through"})
      }
    });
    </script>

This will bind an event handler for *showoff:next* to your slide. When you press
the right arrow key the first time, the h1-element will be decorated. When you
press the right array key another time, you will switch to the next slide.

The same applies to the *showoff:prev* event, of course.


= Custom Stylesheets

To insert custom Stylesheets into your presentation you can either place it into
a file (with extension .css) into the root directory of your presentation or
you can embed a <code><link></code> element directly into your slides. This stylesheet will
be applied as soon as it is loaded.

The content generated by the slide is wrapped with a <tt>div</tt> with the class <tt>.content</tt> like this.

    <div ref="intro/01_slide/1" class="content" style="margin-top: 210px;">
    <h1>jQuery &amp; Sinatra</h1>
    <h2>A Classy Combination</h2>
    </div>

This makes the <code>.content</code> tag a perfect place to add additional styling if that
is your preference. An example of adding some styling might look like:

    .content {
      color: black;
      font-family: helvetica, arial;
    }
    h1, h2 {
      color: rgb(79, 180, 226);
      font-family: Georgia;
    }
    .content::after {
      position: absolute;
      right: 120px;
      bottom: 120px;
      content: url(jay_small.png);
    }

Note that the example above uses CSS3 styling with <tt>::after</tt> and the <tt>content</tt>
-attribute to add an image to the slides. Another example might be to customize the <tt>Console</tt>
styling to look more retro:

    /* rock it old school */
    pre.highlight code.language-console,
    pre.highlight code.console {
      color: #ffcc00; /* amber */
      font-weight: bold;
    }

If you would like to use CSS to change the size of your slides from the default of
1024x768, you'll want to use rules such as:

    #preso,
    .slide {
        width: 1280px !important;
        height: 800px !important;
    }

You can style individual paragraphs and images by including a class name prefixed with a
period as the first word of the text or of the description. For example, a styled paragraph
would look like:

    .customstyle This is a paragraph of text. It's nothing special except that the
    <tt>&lt;p&rt;</tt> tag will have the class <tt>customstyle</tt> applied to it.

A styled image will look like:

    ![.fancyborder This is a really fancy image](../_images/unicorns_and_rainbows.png)


= Custom Fonts

It's easy to use custom fonts in your presentations by including the font files in your
presentation directory and referencing them from your stylesheets.

For example, you may have declarations in your stylesheet to define the font you want
to use and the file to load the font from. Remember that the path to the font should
include the <tt>file/</tt> prefix.

    @font-face {
    	font-family: 'Tibetan Bold';
    	src: URL('file/NotoSansTibetan-Bold.ttf') format ('ttf');
    }

    @font-face {
    	font-family: 'Tibetan';
    	src: URL('file/NotoSansTibetan-Regular.ttf') format ('ttf');
    }

Then you can use that named <tt>font-family</tt> anywhere in your styles.

    .content {
      font-family: 'Tibetan';
    }
    .content h1 {
      font-family: 'Tibetan Bold';
    }

A good source of fonts covering all languages is the {Google Noto Font project}[https://www.google.com/get/noto/].

= Templates

Templates can come handy if you need more than what you can achieve
via CSS. To configure templates you'll have to specify them in the
<tt>showoff.json</tt> by adding an entry called "templates". This
entry is an object where you can specify as many templates as you
want. The default template is marked with the "default" key.

     {
      "name": "Something",
      "description": "Example Presentation",
      "templates" : {
          "default" : "tpl1.tpl",
          "special" : "tpl2.tpl"
      },
      "sections": [
        {"section":"one"}
      ]
    }

If the "default" key is not given, no template will be used for the
default slide. If you want to apply a certain layout to a slide you
have to specify it in the slide header:

     !SLIDE[tpl=special]
     # Header

== Template Commands

You can place content anywhere in your template, but you have to
explicitly mark the location using a special command:

[~~~CONTENT~~~] is replaced by the slide content

[~~~CURRENT_SLIDE~~~] is replaced by the current slide number

[~~~NUM_SLIDES~~~] is replaced by the total number of slides

[~~~CONFIG:*~~~] is replaced by any value (*) from the <tt>showoff.json</tt> configuration. This can be used to specify an author, venue, etc. A simple example would be <tt>~~~CONFIG:author~~~</tt>

The usage of these replacements is not limited to templates, but
anywhere in your slides.

== Template Hints

You can basically put everything you want into templates, but you
should make sure that the CSS is applied fine. The best way to apply a
custom layout is to create a container that uses absolute positioning
and has width and height set to 100% which are then derived from the
parent slide element.

= Live code execution

Showoff can execute code from a slide and display the results live for
demonstration purposes.  To do this, mark your code block with the keyword
<tt>execute</tt>. Any code that Showoff has handlers for can be executed. This
includes:

[Executed directly in the browser]
  - Coffeescript
  - Javascript

[Executed on the machine running the Showoff presentation]
  - Perl
  - Puppet
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - Shell

See PRESENTATION.rdoc to learn how to define your own handlers to evaluate any
language you'd like.

*Security*: code must exist in a slide file on disk for Showoff to execute it.
This doesn't mean that you're immune from attack though. It's possible to create
a presentation with embedded Javascript that will automatically call back and
execute malicious code on a slide. To help mitigate this attack profile, Showoff
must be started with the <tt>-x</tt> or <tt>--executecode</tt> flags to enable
code execution.

== Shell code

    @@@ Shell execute
    find . -name '*.md'

== Ruby code

    @@@ Ruby execute
    [1,2,3,4].map do |num|
        num * num
    end

If you need supporting libraries when you evaluate Ruby code, you can put Ruby
files (<tt>*.rb</tt>) into the root directory of the presentation and they will be
auto-required when the presentation loads.

= Editor Support

The "add slide" feature can allow you to add the necessary boilerplate from your editor.

[TextMate Bundle]

[Emacs]
  - major-mode - showoff-mode
  - Nick Parker

[vim]
  - <tt>!showoff add -t code Check This Code</tt>

  And your buffer will get

      !SLIDE
      # Check This Code #
          @@@ Ruby
          code_here()

  added where your cursor was.  Binding this to a keybinding can allow you to add
  new slides quickly. See the commandline[rdoc-ref:COMMANDLINE] section for
  interesting Showoff commands.
