It can be difficult to install all the dependencies to be able to generate PDFs
using the Gtk3 webkit stack.  As a proof of concept, and as a means of running 
the system when a correctly configured system is unavailable, we include a VM
system description, running on VirtualBox, to make it possible to setup a working
system.

To get the VM running properly, do the following:

 - install virtualbox (https://www.virtualbox.org/)
 - gem install vagrant
 - cd setup
 - vagrant box add ubuntu1110 http://timhuegdon.com/vagrant-boxes/ubuntu-11.10.box
 - vagrant up    # note: you will need to be connected to the Internet

At that point you should be able to access the VM system and run a PDF generation
test:

 - vagrant ssh
   % cd showup/setup/pdf
   % sh -x ./test.sh

 (from the host machine, not inside the VM):

 - open pdf/screenshot.pdf

 
To shut down the VM:

 - vagrant halt
