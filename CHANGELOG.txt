      * Bullets you haven't gotten to yet are dimmed, not hidden.

  * Minor bugfixes.

0.9.10.4
  * Bugfix release: don't initialize stats collection unless presenting

0.9.10.3
  * Adds the ability to merge in personal notes to the presenter notes.
    See AUTHORING.rdoc for instructions.
  * Generate valid HTML IDs for slides.

0.9.10.2
  * More robust static content generation--don't prematurely fail if a file
    isn't found.
  * Fixed some form generation regular expressions on Ruby 1.8.

0.9.10.1
  * Continuing on in the grand tradition of rapid point releases, this is
    a minor, yet important, errata fix. Current versions of RedCarpet did
    not work with both instructor notes and `:strikethrough` enabled. This
    release turns `:strikethrough` back off and a future update will rework
    the syntax for instructor notes.
  * Enables static supplemental material generation
  * Output cleaner HTML
  * Allows running without a `showoff.json` config file again.

0.9.10
  * Fresh coat of paint on the presenter view. This uses the CSS3 flexbox
    model, so it's much cleaner and will allow more UI work in the future.
    (thanks to @jolshevski for some of the UI cleanup)
  * Slide menu in the presenter view now follows the current slide.
  * Audience questions can now be dismissed by clicking on them.
  * Smartphone remote view simplified, now with hamburger menu button.
  * Enables more Markdown extensions such as:
    * `autolink`: automatically recognize links
    * `definition_lists`: PHP-Markdown style definition lists
    * `no_intra_emphasis`: mid-word underscores don't screw up formatting
    * `strikethrough`: surround words with `~~` to strikethrough
    * `superscript`: superscript text using `^`
    * `tables`: PHP-Markdown style tables
    * `underline`: Use underscores for underline instead of emphasis

These defaults are documented in AUTHORING.rdoc and can be disabled with some
variation of this in your `showoff.json` file:

    "redcarpet" : {
      "autolink"          : false,
      "no_intra_emphasis" : false,
      "strikethrough"     : false,
      "superscript"       : false,
      "tables"            : false,
      "underline"         : false
    }
