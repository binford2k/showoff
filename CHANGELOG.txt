0.20.1
  * Font Awesome changed a lot of class names and the like. This fixes them.
  * Added the ability to specify additional styles and scripts in your presentation.
  * Fixed a couple path problems.
  * Switched to a better way of printing from the presenter
  * UI fixes

0.20.0
  * Update Font Awesome to the latest
  * Prevented tours from loading every time you use the presenter
  * Fix PDFkit printing
  * Add languages from strings.json to the language selector
  * Add ability to line-number code blocks
  * Some minor UI cleanups
  * The usual IE mitigations
  * Removed the asset_path handling. Please read note below.

Prior versions of Showoff used a pretty fragile form of path munging that allowed
it to handle serving multiple presentations with the same server. That's not been
a fully supported use case for years now, and it prevented other kinds of usage,
like using a reverse proxy to run multiple services on different paths on a web
server. If this behaviour is important to you, then please pin to v0.19.6 and
file a ticket explaining your use case.

Going forward, the supported method for running multiple presentations from the
same base URL will be to configure something like nginx to proxy different paths
to multiple Showoff instances running. Simplifying in this way will also make it
far far easier to run multiple containerized instances.

Also note that this was a rather large and invasive change, so I expect that
testing may not catch all issues. Please report any problems you find!

          * https://github.com/puppetlabs/showoff/issues

    presentation. Add your own validation commands by defining `validators`.
  * Validates perl/python/ruby/shell/puppet code snippets.

Removed functionality:
  * RMagick support has been removed. Browsers can autoscale images on demand
    pretty well now, so you probably won't miss it much.

0.12.2

  * The new `showoff skeleton` command will take a `showoff.json` file, either
    in the current working directory or via a `-f` path option, and generate a
    full file & directory structure with starter slide files for you. It's safe
    to run on existing presentations; it will only create missing files, not
    overwrite existing files.

Deprecation warning:
  * RMagick will be completely removed in the next major release. Please migrate
    away from it now. Browsers can autoscale images on demand pretty well now,
    so you probably won't miss it much.

0.12.0
  * ##### WARNING: This is a major breaking change! ######
  * You will need to CLEAR YOUR BROWSER CACHE before presenting.
  * The visual look has been drastically improved.
  * The default slide styles have been improved greatly. This means that if you
    have built custom styles, you **will need to update your styles!**
  * The slides now scale much more cleanly. Ctrl+ and Ctrl- to your heart's content.
  * Many performance improvements.
  * The toolbar has been cleaned up with deprecated functionality being replaced
    more useful buttons.

New command:
  * To replace deprecated features, we added a new `showoff pdf` command. This
    uses `pdfkit` to build the PDF file, which you can then put into `_files/share`
    if you'd like the the audience to download it. This means the file is built once
    instead of each time the endpoint is hit! Much faster and also removed a race
    condition.

Endpoint removal:
  * Some lesser used endpoints were removed. Notably, `/onepage` and `/pdf` are gone.
  * The `/print` endpoint had been a better replacement for `/onepage` for a long time.

0.11.2
  * Fix some small styling issues.
  * Drop IE8 support as it has passed EOL.

    form question has received.

    autogenerating self-signed certificates.
  * Record user-agent in stats to help identify browser support for
    future content updates.
  * Faster content loading for audience members.
  * Add full documentation of the `showoff.json` settings in one place.
  * Bugfix: internal links in notes no longer open in new tabs.

  * Corrected again print styling regression.

0.10.1
  * Corrected print styling regression.

      * Added Perl, Puppet, Python, Shell interpreters
  * Follow mode on by default

Compatibility note:
If you are currently styling code blocks in your presentations then you will
need to update your selectors. Here is an example that will style both earlier
Showoff versions and current.

    /* Add some nice styling to the code blocks. */
    .content pre:not(.highlight),
    .content pre.highlight code {
        border: 2px solid #ddd;
        padding: 0.5em;
        overflow: hidden;
        -moz-border-radius: 10px;
        -webkit-border-radius: 10px;
        -khtml-border-radius: 10px;
        border-radius: 10px;
        display: block;
    }

  * Fixed some form generation regular expressions on Ruby 1.8.

0.9.10.1
  * Continuing on in the grand tradition of rapid point releases, this is
    a minor, yet important, errata fix. Current versions of RedCarpet did
    not work with both instructor notes and `:strikethrough` enabled. This
    release turns `:strikethrough` back off and a future update will rework
    the syntax for instructor notes.
  * Enables static supplemental material generation
  * Output cleaner HTML
  * Allows running without a `showoff.json` config file again.

0.9.10
  * Fresh coat of paint on the presenter view. This uses the CSS3 flexbox
    model, so it's much cleaner and will allow more UI work in the future.
    (thanks to @jolshevski for some of the UI cleanup)
  * Slide menu in the presenter view now follows the current slide.
  * Audience questions can now be dismissed by clicking on them.
  * Smartphone remote view simplified, now with hamburger menu button.
  * Enables more Markdown extensions such as:
    * `autolink`: automatically recognize links
    * `definition_lists`: PHP-Markdown style definition lists
    * `no_intra_emphasis`: mid-word underscores don't screw up formatting
    * `strikethrough`: surround words with `~~` to strikethrough
    * `superscript`: superscript text using `^`
    * `tables`: PHP-Markdown style tables
    * `underline`: Use underscores for underline instead of emphasis

These defaults are documented in AUTHORING.rdoc and can be disabled with some
variation of this in your `showoff.json` file:

    "redcarpet" : {
      "autolink"          : false,
      "no_intra_emphasis" : false,
      "strikethrough"     : false,
      "superscript"       : false,
      "tables"            : false,

  I had to massage several commits, and had to re-implement a couple.
