          * https://github.com/puppetlabs/showoff/issues

  * Add .thumbsup callout style
  * Extended showoff init to support multiple directories
  * Fix the download page lack of scrolling

New command:
  * The new `showoff validate` command will ensure that all directories and
    slide files listed in the `showoff.json` file exist and then will run
    validation commands against all code blocks of known styles in your
    presentation. Add your own validation commands by defining `validators`.
  * Validates perl/python/ruby/shell/puppet code snippets.

Removed functionality:
  * RMagick support has been removed. Browsers can autoscale images on demand
    pretty well now, so you probably won't miss it much.

0.12.2
  * Fixed some glaring UI bugs with the new callout styles.
  * Cleaned up and fixed some command line interactions.

  * Updated code execution styles.

  * The new `showoff skeleton` command will take a `showoff.json` file, either
    in the current working directory or via a `-f` path option, and generate a
    full file & directory structure with starter slide files for you. It's safe
    to run on existing presentations; it will only create missing files, not
    overwrite existing files.

Deprecation warning:
  * RMagick will be completely removed in the next major release. Please migrate
    away from it now. Browsers can autoscale images on demand pretty well now,
    so you probably won't miss it much.

0.12.0
  * ##### WARNING: This is a major breaking change! ######
  * You will need to CLEAR YOUR BROWSER CACHE before presenting.
  * The visual look has been drastically improved.
  * The default slide styles have been improved greatly. This means that if you
    have built custom styles, you **will need to update your styles!**
  * The slides now scale much more cleanly. Ctrl+ and Ctrl- to your heart's content.
  * Many performance improvements.
  * The toolbar has been cleaned up with deprecated functionality being replaced
    more useful buttons.

New command:
  * To replace deprecated features, we added a new `showoff pdf` command. This
    uses `pdfkit` to build the PDF file, which you can then put into `_files/share`
    if you'd like the the audience to download it. This means the file is built once
    instead of each time the endpoint is hit! Much faster and also removed a race
    condition.

Endpoint removal:
  * Some lesser used endpoints were removed. Notably, `/onepage` and `/pdf` are gone.
  * The `/print` endpoint had been a better replacement for `/onepage` for a long time.

0.11.2
  * Fix some small styling issues.
  * Drop IE8 support as it has passed EOL.

    autogenerating self-signed certificates.

    future content updates.
  * Faster content loading for audience members.
  * Add full documentation of the `showoff.json` settings in one place.
  * Bugfix: internal links in notes no longer open in new tabs.

  * Corrected again print styling regression.

0.10.1
  * Corrected print styling regression.

Compatibility note:
If you are currently styling code blocks in your presentations then you will
need to update your selectors. Here is an example that will style both earlier
Showoff versions and current.

    /* Add some nice styling to the code blocks. */
    .content pre:not(.highlight),
    .content pre.highlight code {
        border: 2px solid #ddd;
        padding: 0.5em;
        overflow: hidden;
        -moz-border-radius: 10px;
        -webkit-border-radius: 10px;
        -khtml-border-radius: 10px;
        border-radius: 10px;
        display: block;
    }

  * Fixed some form generation regular expressions on Ruby 1.8.

0.9.10.1
  * Continuing on in the grand tradition of rapid point releases, this is
    a minor, yet important, errata fix. Current versions of RedCarpet did
    not work with both instructor notes and `:strikethrough` enabled. This
    release turns `:strikethrough` back off and a future update will rework
    the syntax for instructor notes.
  * Enables static supplemental material generation
  * Output cleaner HTML
  * Allows running without a `showoff.json` config file again.

0.9.10
  * Fresh coat of paint on the presenter view. This uses the CSS3 flexbox
    model, so it's much cleaner and will allow more UI work in the future.
    (thanks to @jolshevski for some of the UI cleanup)
  * Slide menu in the presenter view now follows the current slide.
  * Audience questions can now be dismissed by clicking on them.
  * Smartphone remote view simplified, now with hamburger menu button.
  * Enables more Markdown extensions such as:
    * `autolink`: automatically recognize links
    * `definition_lists`: PHP-Markdown style definition lists
    * `no_intra_emphasis`: mid-word underscores don't screw up formatting
    * `strikethrough`: surround words with `~~` to strikethrough
    * `superscript`: superscript text using `^`
    * `tables`: PHP-Markdown style tables
    * `underline`: Use underscores for underline instead of emphasis

These defaults are documented in AUTHORING.rdoc and can be disabled with some
variation of this in your `showoff.json` file:

    "redcarpet" : {
      "autolink"          : false,
      "no_intra_emphasis" : false,
      "strikethrough"     : false,
      "superscript"       : false,
