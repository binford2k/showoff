Contributing
======================

To contribute to the Showoff project:

* Fork puppetlabs/showoff

* Use the ShowOff project in the 'example/' subdirectory to 
  add an example of new features or make sure you haven't
  broken existing functionality.  I basically use this preso
  as my unit tests.

* Push your contribution to a branch named after your change
  ie: git push origin master:fixed-static-links

* Send me a pull request through GitHub with a description of
  what you are contributing.
